# fcoo-maps-colors
> JS, css, and SCSS mixins defining the colors and color-system for marker, lines etc. in [FCOO/fcoo-maps](https://github.com/FCOO/fcoo-maps)

## Description

Based on the Color Palettes defined in [FCOO/fcoo-colors](https://github.com/FCOO/fcoo-colors) this packages defines (almost) all the colors used in the different `fcoo-map-LAYER` packages setting up the different layers

It defines a number of SCSS and JC color-variables for different type of layer, provides a number of SCSS mixins to create css-classes, and create css for many of the layers available to [FCOO/fcoo-maps](https://github.com/FCOO/fcoo-maps)


## Installation

## Colors

The general idea is to use each color-group to a specific group of layers. Different layers within a group can have different gradients of the same color

### Color-groups and scss-variables

There are 9 color-groups:

    0:Blue 1:Purple  2:Red  3:Orange  4:Cyan  5:Yellow  6:Pink  7:Green  8:Gray

Each color-group comes in 9 different gradients (0-9). 
The standard gradient for all color-groups is 4, but some for some purposes a different gradient is used 

#### Syntax
Below is a overview of the use of and scss-variables for each color-group.

The syntax is `$VARIABLE_NAME: COLOR-NAME[DELTA-GRADIENT]`

Where `COLOR-NAME` are one of the color-groups and `DELTA-GRADIENT` (optional) is +/- 1-3

Eq.

    $the-name-of-a-color: Yellow+1;
Means that `$the-name-of-a-color` has the value `#E6A700`

#### SCSS-variables
The 'global' scss-variables are defined in

    src/_fcoo-maps-colors-variables.scss
